The first section of your report should contain a description of the problem and the methods that you plan to use.This is intended just as a brief recall, to introduce some notation and specify which variants of the methods you areplanning to use exactly. Discuss the reasons behind the choices you make (the one you can make, that is, since severalof them will be dictated by the statement of the project and cannot be questioned).Your target audience should be someone who is already sufficiently familiar with the content of the course. Thisisnotthe place to show your knowledge and repeat a large part of the theory: we are sure that you all can do that,1
2 Structure of your report2given enough time, books, slides, and internet bandwidth. A more in-depth mathematical part is expected in the nextstage.In case adapting the algorithm to your problem requires some further mathematical derivation (example: developingan exact line search for your problem, when possible, or adapting an algorithm to deal more efficiently with the specialstructure of your problem), you are supposed to discuss it here with all the necessary mathematical detail.You are advised to send us a version of this section by e-mail as soon as it is done, so that we can catch misunder-standings as soon as possible and minimize the amount of work wasted. Note that we do not want to see code at thispoint: that would be premature to produce (for you) and unnecessarily complicated to read (for us).
