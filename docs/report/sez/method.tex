\section{Method}

\subsection{Momentum descent approach}
The momentum descent approach add to the deterministic gradient descent a technique for accelerating gradient descent that accumulates a velocity vector in directions of persistent reduction in the objective across iterations. 
\\
This algorithm is a gradient-based optimization. The main idea of this type of algorithm is to minimize a loss function (or cost/error function) following the direction given by the gradient computed in the current point of the function.
\\
What can be a problem in the gradient descent is the large amount of example that must be computed for each iteration. The opposite happens in the stochastic gradient descent where there is an online training. However, the SGD is not as stable as the classical GD, but it requires only the evaluation of one example for each iteration. 
Form now on, when we talk about SGD, we refers to SGD with a subset of training dataset, called mini-batch or batch SGD.

Momentum descent approach use momentum to accelerate learning. It introduce a variable \textbf{v} that take account of the speed and direction at which the parameters move through parameter space. The role of momentum is determined by the hyperparameter $\alpha\in[0,1)$.
The update rule is the following:
\begin{equation}
\label{classical_momentum}
\textbf{v}_k = \alpha\textbf{v}_{k-1} + \eta\nabla\textit{L}(\textbf{W}_k).
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\label{update_momentum}
\textbf{W}_k = \textbf{W}_{k-1}  + \textbf{v}_k.
\end{equation}
We would like to observe that the method choose a descent direction equals to $\frac{\partial f}{\partial d_i}(x_i)<0$. This means that $\langle d_i, \nabla f(x_i)\rangle <0$ and the $\cos(\theta_i)>0$. The main idea is to take the information given by the directional derivatives on the way that our function decrease and follow this directions. So, the method follow a descent direction, the best case is to take the direction $d_i$ with the same direction of $-\nabla f(x_i)$.\\
The Nesterov momentum is a variant of the classical Momentum, the main idea is to add a correction factor at the classical momentum,  for this reason they differs in place where the gradient is evaluated. With Nesterov momentum the rate of convergence goes from $O(\frac{1}{k})$ to $O(\frac{1}{k^2})$.
The update rule for the velocity vector \textbf{v} is the following:
\begin{equation}
\label{nesterov_momentum}
\textbf{v}_k = \alpha\textbf{v}_{k-1} + \eta\nabla\textit{L}(\textbf{W}_k + \alpha\textbf{v}_{k-1}).
\end{equation}

		\State Apply update: $\textbf{W} \gets \textbf{W} + \textbf{v}$
		\EndWhile
		\EndProcedure
	\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\subsubsection{Method convergence}
\label{MDA-convergence}
Convergence of this algorithm is strictly connected to the choice of $\eta$, the learning rate parameter. It is important to gradually decrease $\eta$ over iterations, in order to guarantee convergence. A sufficient condition to ensure convergence of momentum descent is that 
\begin{equation}
\label{assumption:momentum_descent}
\sum_k \eta_k=\infty \  \text{ and } \ \sum_k \eta_k^2 < \infty
\end{equation}
\\
The convergence rate is of $O(\frac{1}{\sqrt{k}})$ (after k steps) when the algorithm is applied to a convex problem. 
Moreover, if we assume that the Hessian matrix $\nabla^2f(x_*)$ is positive definite, means that the loss function is a strongly convex function and the convergence rate is $O(\frac{1}{k})$. \cite{goodfellow}

Our objective function is not convex, so we need more constraint in order to use what we said before.
D.P. Bertsekas proved the following, which appears as proposition 1.2.4 of \cite{bert03}.
\\ Let \{$x_k$\} be a sequence generated by a gradient method $x_{k+1}=x_k+\alpha_kd_k$. Assume that for some constant L>0 we have
\begin{equation}
\label{assumption:momentum_descent2}
\| \nabla f(x)-\nabla f(y)\|\leq L\|x-y\|, \forall x,y \in R^n
\end{equation}
and that there exist positive scalars $c_1$, $c_2$ such that for all $k$  we have respect the Armijo-Wolfe conditions.
Suppose also that
\begin{equation}
\label{assumption:momentum_descent4}
\eta_k \to 0 \  \text{ , } \ \sum_k \eta_k = \infty
\end{equation}
The either $f(x_k)\to - \infty$ or else \{$f(x_k)$\} converges to a finite value and $\nabla f(x_k) \to 0$. Furthermore, every limit point of \{$x_k$\} is a stationary point of $f$.
The first fundamentals observation is that the loss function that we choose is a quadratic loss function and it is two times Lipschitz continue and derivable (as we said in \ref{LF:Properties}).

\subsection{Limited-memory quasi-Newton methods}
Limited-memory Quasi-Newton methods are useful for solving large unconstrained optimization problems in which Hessian matrices cannot be computed at a reasonable cost. More formally to minimize a function using the second order information, we create a quadratic model that approximate the function at the current $x_{k}$:
\begin{equation}
m_{k}(p)=L_{k}(p)+ \frac{1}{2}(p-k)^T\nabla^2 f(k)(p-k).
\end{equation}
where $L_{k}(p)$ is the first order model and the remaining is the second order term. Then we minimize the function using the information given by the model $m_{k}$ and the direction compute as 
\begin{equation}
d_{k} \leftarrow -[\nabla^2f(x_{k})]^{-1}\nabla f(x_{k}).
\end{equation}

Theoretically  the Hessian matrix $\nabla^2 f(k)$ needs to be recomputed at every iteration. Instead in the Quasi-Netwon method the Hessian is substitute by an approximation $ H_{k}$ to reduce the cost. 

The main idea of L-BFGS is to use the curvature information from the $m$ previously step to construct $B_{k}$, the inverse of the Hessian ($H_{k}^{-1}$), to avoid using $O(n^2)$ storage. The information about $B_{k}$ is stored inside vectors of length $n$. Earlier iterations parameters are discarded in the interest of saving storage.

\subsubsection{Limited memory BFGS}
\label{L-BFGS}
In the Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno algorithm (BFGS) each step use the information given by the gradient $\nabla f_{k}$ and the approximated inverse of the Hessian $B_{k}$ to minimize  a function updating its parameters $x_{k}$. Each step has the form: 
\begin{equation}
\label{direction}
x_{k+1} = x_{k} - \alpha_{k}B_{k}\nabla f_{k}
\end{equation} 
where $\alpha_{k}$ is the step length.

In L-BFGS method to handle the complexity of storing an approximation of the Hessian, we save a certain number of vector $m$ composed of 
\begin{align}
s_{k}=x_{k+1}-x_{k}=\alpha_{k}d_{k}, & \qquad
y_{k}=\nabla f_{k+1} - \nabla f_{k}.
\end{align}
We can now approximate the product $B_{k}\nabla f_{k}$ by doing multiple products and vector summation using the $m$ vectors $\{s_{i},y_{i}\}$. At step $k$ after we compute the new iterate and the oldest vector $\{s_{m},y_{m}\}$ is replaced with the new one.

We first choose some initial Hessian approximation $B^0_{k}$ that is allowed to vary from iteration to iteration and then we find $B_{k}$ with

\begin{equation} 
\begin{aligned}
&B_{k}=(V^T_{k-1}\cdots V^T_{k-m})B^0_{k}(V_{k-m}\cdots V_{k-1})\\           
&+\rho_{k-m}(V^T_{k-1}\cdots V^T_{k-m+1})s_{k-m}s^T_{k-m}(V_{k-m+1}\cdots V_{k-1})\\
&+\rho_{k-m+1}(V^T_{k-1}\cdots V^T_{k-m+2})s_{k-m+1}s^T_{k-m+1}(V_{k-m+2}\cdots V_{k-1})\\
&+ \cdots \\
&+\rho_{k-1}s_{k-1}s^T_{k-1}.  
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

where
\begin{align}
\rho_{k}= \frac{1}{y^T_{k}s_{k}}, & \qquad
V_{k} = I - \rho_{k} y_{k}s^T_{k},
\end{align}
formulas taken from \cite{numerical}.

Now we can derive an algorithm to compute the product $B_{k}\nabla f_{k}$

\begin{algorithm}[H]
	\caption{L-BFGS two loop recursion}
	\label{L-BFGSTwoLoop}
	\begin{algorithmic}[3]
	
		\State $q \gets \nabla f_{k}$;
		\For{$i=k-1,k-2,\cdots ,k-m$}
        \State $ \alpha_{i} \gets \rho_{i}s^T_{i}q$;
        \State $q \gets q - \alpha_{i}y_{i}$; 
      \EndFor
 	  \State $r \gets B^0_{k}q$;
 	  \For{$i=k-m,k-m+1,\cdots, k-1$}
 	  \State $\beta \gets \rho_{i}y^T_{i}r$; 
 	  \State $r \gets r + s_{i}(\alpha_{i}-\beta)$
 	  \EndFor
	  \State \textbf{stop} with result $B_{k}\nabla f_{k}=r$
	\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}


A method for choosing $B^0_{k}$ that has proved effective in practice is to set $B^0_{k}=\gamma_{k}I$  where 
\begin{equation}
\gamma_{k}= \frac{s^T_{k-1}y_{k-1}}{y^T_{k-1}y_{k-1}}
\end{equation}

$\gamma_{k}$ is the scaling factor that attempts to estimate the size of the true Hessian matrix along the most recent search direction \cite{numerical}. This choice helps to ensure that the search direction $p_{k}$ is well scaled.

To keep the update stable using the approximated inverse of the Hessian $B_{k}$ we impose a condition (the first one is already satisfied) based on the knowledge gained during the latest step. The new model must respects old information 
\begin{equation}
\nabla m_{k+1}(x_{k})=\nabla f(x_{k}),
\end{equation}
that is ensured if the \textit{secant equation}
\label{secant-equation}
\begin{equation}
B_{k+1}y_{k}=s_{k}
\end{equation}
is satisfied. This is possible if $s_{k}$ and $y_{k}$ satisfy the \textit{curvature condition} 
\begin{equation}
s_{k}^T y_{k}>0.
\end{equation}
The \textit{curvature condition} is satisfied when $f$ is strongly convex but for nonconvex functions we need to restrict the step $\alpha_{k}$ used in the line search procedure to guarantee the satisfiability of it.
Moreover the \textit{curvature condition} is satisfied in the line search if we impose Wolfe conditions
\begin{equation}
f(x_k + \alpha_kp_k ) \leq f (x_k ) + c_1 \alpha_k \nabla f_k^T p_k,
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\nabla f(x_k + \alpha_{k} p_k )^T p_k \geq c_2 \nabla f_k^T p_k ,
\end{equation}
or strong Wolfe conditions
\begin{equation}
f(x_k + \alpha_kp_k ) \leq f (x_k ) + c_1 \alpha_k \nabla f_k^T p_k,
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
|\nabla f(x_k + \alpha_{k} p_k )^T p_k| \leq c_2 |\nabla f_k^T p_k| ,
\end{equation}
with 0<$c_1$<$c_2$<1. 

As shown in \cite{numerical}, we need to ensure that among all the symmetric matrix satisfying the secant equation, $B_{k+1}$ is the closest to the current matrix $
B_{k}$. This condition of closeness to $B_{k}$ is resolved by solving the problem
\begin{equation}
B_{k+1} = \min_{B} \{\parallel B - B_{k} \parallel\} 
\end{equation}
with 
\begin{equation}
B = B^T, \quad B{y_{k}}= s_{k}
\end{equation}
for appropriate $\parallel \cdot \parallel$ the formula to compute $B_{k+1}$ is found.


\subsubsection{Algorithm}
Limited-memory variants  of  the  quasi-Newton  approach use  Hessian  approximations  that  can  be stored compactly by using just few vectors of length \textit{n}. These methods are fairly robust, inexpensive and easy to implement.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
	\caption{L-BFGS.}
	\label{alg:LBFGS}
	\begin{algorithmic}[4]
		\Require{Starting point $x_0$;}
		\Require{Integer m>0;}
		\Require{Maximum number of iteration and error threshold;}
		\Procedure{LBFGS}{}
		\State Compute $k \gets 0$;
		\Repeat
		\State Choose \textbf{$B^0_k$};
		\State Compute $p_k \gets B_k\nabla \textit{f}_k$;
		\State Compute $x_{k+1} \gets x_{k}+ \alpha_{k}p_{k}$ where $\alpha_{k}$ is chosen to satisfy the Wolfe condition;
		\If {k>m}
		\State Discard the vector pair \{$s_{k-m},y_{k-m}$\} from storage;
		\EndIf
		\State Compute and save $s_k \gets x_{k+1}-x_{k}, y_k=\nabla \textit{f}_{k+1}-\textit{f}_k$;
		\State $k \gets k+1$
		\Until{\textbf{convergence.}}
		\EndProcedure 
	\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

Each iteration can be performed at cost of $O(mn)$ arithmetic operations, where $m$ is the number of steps stored in memory.

\subsubsection{Algorithm Convergence}
\label{L-BFGSConv}
L-BFGS guarantee global convergence under specific assumption:
\begin{enumerate} \label{convergence:assumption}
	\item The objective function f is twice continuously differentiable;
	\item To take the correct descent direction the approximated inverse Hessian $B_{k}$ need to be positive definite.
\end{enumerate}


Assumption 1 is satisfied, since our loss function f is twice continuously differentiable as we said in \ref{LF:Properties}. 
                                                       
Assumption 2 can be satisfied by adding to computed approximated Hessian a positive diagonal matrix.
The first method is to choose small $\epsilon^i$ such that $H^i=\nabla^2f(x^i) + \epsilon^iI\succ0$, any $\epsilon^i>-\lambda^n$ works but brings numerical issue. 
The second method is to compute spectral decomposition of $\nabla^2f(x^i)=H\wedge H$, where $\wedge$ is a diagonal matrix whose diagonal elements are the corresponding eigenvalues, and then replace all the negative eigenvalues by a small positive number $\delta$ that is larger than machine precision so $H^i=H\overline{\wedge}H \textnormal{ with } \overline{\gamma}=max\{\lambda^i,\delta\}$. But in both cases the cost is $O(n^3)$, too large for big problem. Another method is to use trust region method, in fact $Q_{x^i}(y)$ has no minimum on $R^n$ but it does on a compact set. So 
\begin{equation}
x^{i+1} \in \textnormal{ argmin}\{Q_{x^i}(y):y\in \tau^i\},
\end{equation}
my model can be trust inside a small ball $\tau^i$ created around the point where I am right now.

Although, L-BFGS computes an approximation of the inverse of the Hessian $B_{k}$ that is directly multiplied with the gradient $\nabla f_{k}$ to obtain a direction $p_{k}$ (see algorithm \ref{L-BFGSTwoLoop}), so methods that manually modify the Hessian to make it positive definite are not used. Indeed, to produce a descent direction we need to guarantee that $B_{k+1}$  will be positive definite. This is true whenever $B_{k}$ (past approximation) is positive definite, as shown in \cite{numerical} section 6.1 (subsection "Properties of the BFGS method"). Produce $B_{k+1}$ that is correctly defined is ensured whenever the initial approximation $B_{0}$ (first $B_{k}$) is positive definite and the \textit{secant equation} is satisfied for every $k$ step of the minimization process (which is our case since $B_{0}$ it is initialized as positive definite and the secant equation is checked at every iteration). 

Also if the $\alpha_{k}$ (step length) is computed by an inexact line search that satisfies the Wolfe conditions and the first step tried has always value equal to 1, then the search direction of a quasi-Newton method approximates the Newton direction well enough so that the step size $\alpha_{k}$ will satisfy the Wolfe conditions as the iterates converge to the solution (as reported in \cite{numerical}). This present a condition that if it is satisfied produce a superlinearly convergent iteration for all $x_{k}$ in the proximity of a solution $x_{*}$. The assumption is formally proved in \cite{numerical} (Theorem 3.6): suppose that $f: \textnormal{ }\mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is twice continuously differentiable. Consider the iteration $x_{k+1} = x_{k} + \alpha_{k}d_{k}$, where $d_{k}$ is a descent direction and $\alpha_{k}$ satisfies the Wolfe conditions with $c_{1} <= \frac{1}{2}$ (which is our case). If the sequence $\{ x_{k} \}$ converges to a point $x_{*}$ such that $\nabla f(x_{*}) = 0$ and $\nabla^2f(x_{*})$ is positive definite, and if the search direction satisfies: 
\begin{equation}
\label{FirstConditionAlpha}
 \lim_{k\to\infty}\frac{\Vert (\nabla f_{k} + \nabla^2 f_{k} d_{k})\Vert}{\Vert d_{k} \Vert} = 0.
\end{equation} 
then 
\begin{itemize}
	\item the step length $\alpha_{k} = 1$ is admissible for all $k$ greater than a certain index $k_{0}$;
	\item if $\alpha_{k} = 1$ for all $k>k_{0}, x_{k}$ converges to $x_{*}$ superlinearly.
\end{itemize}

 Indeed since the objective function is twice continuously differentiable (as mention above), $c_{1}<\frac{1}{2}$ (we use 1e-4) and $d_{k}$ is equal to $B_{k}\nabla f_{k}$ (which is our case as mention in \ref{direction}) Theorem 3.6 obtained equation \ref{FirstConditionAlpha} is equivalent to: 
\begin{equation}
\label{SecondConditionAlpha}
 \lim_{k\to\infty}\frac{\Vert (B_{k} - \nabla^2f(x_*) d_{k})\Vert}{\Vert d_{k} \Vert} = 0.
\end{equation}

This shows that a superlinear convergence rate can be obtained even if the sequence of $B_{k}$ does not converge to $\nabla^2f(x_*)$. It is sufficient that the $B_{k}$ is positive definite (which is our case as mention above, section 6.1 of \cite{numerical}) and its accuracy approximations increase to $\nabla^2f(x_*)$ progressively. The condition \ref{SecondConditionAlpha} is sufficient to ensure the local superlinear convergence of L-BFGS (more in general of the quasi-Newton methods). This is formalized in \cite{numerical} (precisely in Theorem 3.7):
suppose that $f: \textnormal{ }\mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is twice continuously differentiable. Consider the iteration: $x_{k+1}=x_{k} + p_{k}$ (that is, the step length $\alpha_{k}$ is uniformly 1) and that $p_{k}$ is given by $B_{k}\nabla f_{k}$ (as mention in \ref{direction}). Let us assume that $x_{k}$ converges to a point $x_{*}$ such that $\nabla f(x_{*}) = 0$ and $\nabla^2f(x_{*})$ is positive definite. Then $x_{k}$ converges superlinearly if and only if \ref{SecondConditionAlpha} holds. The proof can be found in \cite{numerical} (Theorem 3.7). 

Clearly, if $m$ is very small the behaviour of L-BFGS will be similar to the Gradient method and if $m$ is very large the behaviour as BFGS. However $m$ is problem dependent so a good trade-off between CPU computational time and convergence speed needs to be found when choosing it.

\subsection{Bundle methods}
\label{Bundle-methods}
Bundle methods are used mainly with non-differentiable loss function. The main idea of these methods is to use the past subgradients as global information. In convex function we know that at each iteration we get a subgradient in which the epigraph of the loss function is always above the epigraph of the subgradient, so epi($L_x$) $ \supseteq $ epi($f$) .\\ 
We define as \{$x_i$\} the sequence of iterates that will hopefully converge at some point $x_*$. 
The bundle of first-order information is:
\begin{equation}
\{x_{k}\}\rightarrow \mathcal{B}=\{(x_{k}, f^k=f(x_{k}), g^{k} \in \partial f(x_{k})\}
\end{equation}
and the cutting-plane model of $f$ - $(1 +\epsilon)$-order model as:
\begin{equation}
\label{CP-model}
f_B(x) = \max{\{f^k+ \langle g^k,x - x_l \rangle:  (x_k,f^k,g^k)\in B\}}
\end{equation}
in which $g^i$ is the subgradient chosen at $i^{th}$ iteration.
Before getting deep in defining the bundle methods, we need to introduce some information about subgradient.
\subsubsection{Subgradient}
The subgradient is a generalization of gradients appropriate for convex functions, including those which are not necessarily smooth.
The subgradient $s$ of $f(x)$ is defined as:
\begin{equation}
f(y) \geq f(x) +s(y-x) \quad \forall y \in \mathbb{R}^n.
\end{equation}
The set of all subgradients at a point is called the sub-differential, and is denoted by $\partial f(x)$. 
If at a point the function is differentiable, the subgradient is exactly the gradient of the function at that point ($\partial f(x)= \{\nabla f(x) \}$).
In a point in which the function is not differentiable, \textit{s} is an infinity set of point closed and convex.
If we choose $s$ such that it respects:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial f}{\partial d}(x)=\sup\{\langle s,d \rangle : s \in \partial f(x)\} 
\end{equation} 
we have that $d$ is a descent direction $\iff \langle s,d\rangle <0 \quad \forall s \in \partial f(x)$.
\\ We defined $s_*$ as the $s$ with the steepest descent direction:
\begin{equation}
s_*= -argmin\{\parallel s\parallel : s\in \partial f(x) \}
\end{equation} 
\subsubsection{Master problem}
We know that $f_B$ is a polyhedral function, for this reason is composed by a finitely number of linear functions.
In this way, we can define the master problem as:
\begin{equation}
\label{MP}
min\{f_B(x)\} = min\{v : v \geq f^k + \langle g^k, x-x_k \rangle \qquad (x_k, f^k, g^k) \in B \}
\end{equation} 
A method to use efficiently the \ref{MP} equation is the \textit{cutting plane algorithm} in which at every iteration we add the knowledge of the $g^i$ sub-gradient at $B$ if the $v^i$ is greater than $f(x_*)$ otherwise we find the optimal value of $f$.  
Unfortunately, the master problem as defined in \ref{MP} have some issue when the $x_i$ is very far to $x_*$. Due to this, the cutting plane algorithm does not work very well in practice.
For this reason, we use a stabilized master problem: 
\begin{equation}
\label{SMP}
 d_{k}=argmin\{f_B(x)\ + \mu \parallel x- \overline{x}\parallel_{2}^2/2 \}
\end{equation} 
in which $\overline{x}$ is a particular point called \textit{stability center} and $\mu$ is the \textit{stability parameter}. We introduce a term that is used to take close the new point $x_{*B}$ from $\overline{x}$.
Usually, $\overline{x}$ is choose as the best $x_i$ at the moment and $\mu$ is an hyperparameter.
We know that at large $\mu$ the parable is extremely sticky and we will do a small movement in the next iteration.
Instead, when we have a small $\mu$, the parable is too flat and in this case we can have the same result as in the un-stabilized cutting plane method. For this reason, is important to find the right $\mu$ to use.
\subsubsection{Proximal Bundle Method}
The main idea behind the Proximal Bundle Method is to approximate the objective function $f$ by the \textit{cutting-plane} model we mention in \ref{CP-model}. To obtain the step size to apply into the result $d_{k}$ obtained solving the \textit{Master problem}, we used the following line search procedure (as described in \cite{NonsmoothOPT}): 
Assume that $m_{L} \in (0, \frac{1}{2}, m_{R} \in (m_{L},1))$ \textnormal{ and } $ \bar{t} \in (0,1])$ are fixed line search parameters. We first search for the largest number $t_{L}^k \in [0,1]$ such that $t_{L}^k \geq \bar{t}$ and
\begin{equation}
\label{linesearchCondition}
f(x_{k}+t_{L}^k d_{k}) \leq f(x_{k}) + m_{L}t_{L}^k v_{k}, 
\end{equation}
where $v_{k}$ is the predicted amount of descent 
\begin{equation}
v_{k} = \hat{f_{k}}(x_{k}+d_{k}) - f(x_{k}) < 0.
\end{equation}
If exists that parameter we take a \textit{long serious step}:
\begin{equation}
x_{k+1} = x_{k} + t_{L}^k d_{k} \textnormal{ and } y_{k+1}= x_{k+1}.
\end{equation}
Otherwise, if \ref{linesearchCondition} holds but $0 < t_{L}^k < \hat{t}$, we take a \textit{short serious step}:
\begin{equation}
x_{k+1} = x_{k} + t_{L}^k d_{k} \textnormal{ and } y_{k+1}= x_{k}+t_{R}^k d_{k}
\end{equation} 
and, if $t_ {L}^k=0$, we take a \textit{null step}: 
\begin{equation}
x_{k+1} = x_{k} + t_{L}^k d_{k} \textnormal{ and } y_{k+1}= x_{k}+t_{R}^k  d_{k}
\end{equation}
where $t_{R}^h > t_{L}^h$ is such that 
\begin{equation}
- \beta_{k+1}^{k+1}+ g^i d_{k} \geq m_{R}v_{k}.
\end{equation}
where 
\begin{equation}
\alpha_{j}^k = f(x_{k}) - f(y_{j}) -g^k(x_{k}-\hat{x})
\end{equation}
is a \textit{linearization error}. In our case, since \textit{f} is non-convex, $\alpha_{j}^k$ can be replaced by $\beta_{j}^k$ called \textit{subgradient locality measure} (see chapter 12 of \cite{NonsmoothOPT}): 
\begin{equation}
\beta_{j}^k = max\{|\alpha_{j}^k|,\gamma || x_{k}-y_{j} ||^2\},
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Algorithm convergence}
\label{PBM-Convergence}
The convergence of the \textit{Bundle method} is guarantee under specific assumption as showed in theorem 7.16 in \cite{NonOpt}:
\begin{enumerate} \label{convergence:assBM}
	\item The function $f$ is convex;
	\item The set $X \in R^n$ is convex and closed.
\end{enumerate}

As mentioned in \cite{PaperBM} and demonstrated by Y. Du and A. Ruszczyński in chapter 4: "Rate of convergence" of \cite{CBM} ("Assumption 6: strong convexity of the function $f(\cdot)$" ) under the assumption that:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The function $f(\cdot)$ has a unique minimum point $x_*$;
	\item $\exists \alpha>0$, such that $f(x)-f(x_*)\geq \alpha \parallel x-x_*\parallel_{2},\forall x \in$ $\rm I\!R^{n}$ $\textnormal{ with } f(x)\leq f(x_1)$ 
	\\ (where $x_1$ are solutions of problems \ref{SMP} at the earlier iterations of the method).
\end{itemize}
  Then the convergence rate is linear. In this case, we suppose that given the number of iteration $k$, the precision of the solution is approximately $O(1/k)$. Without any assumption, the convergence rate is sublinear. 

The convergence theorem does not apply to our case, because our loss function is not convex. We think that this would be relevant in practice, but due to the \textit{Lipschitz continuity} of our loss function we suppose that the method can converge. 

In this direction, the section 4: "Convergence Analysis" of \cite{PBM} helped us to understand that under specific assumption and constraint the proximal bundle method for non convex function surely converge. The assumption are:
\begin{enumerate} \label{convergence:PBM}
	\item The function $f$ is $f^{\circ}$-pseudoconvex  and weakly semismooth;
	\item The constraint functions in $C$ are $f^{\circ}$-pseudoconvex and weakly semismooth;
	\item The constraint qualification 
	\begin{equation}
	\label{CQ}
	C^{\leq}(x)\subseteq K_{s}(x)
	\end{equation}
	where:
	\begin{equation}
	\label{C}
	C(x)= \cup_{j\in B} g_{j}(x), \quad {B}=\{(x,f(x), g \in \partial f(x))\}
	\end{equation}
	and 
	\begin{equation}
	 K_{S}(x) = \{d \in \rm I\!R^{n} | \textnormal{ there} \textnormal{ exist } t_i \downarrow 0 \textnormal{ and } d_{i} \to d \textnormal{ with } (x + t_i*d_i) \in B\}
	\end{equation}
	 is valid.
\end{enumerate}
The set of all constraints $C^{\leq} $ (x) is the set C defined in \ref{C} but the canonical form $\leq$. The constraints in different forms have to be converted to the canonical form that permits only $\leq$ constraints.
\\
The definition of \textit{$f^{\circ}$-pseudoconvex} and \textit{weakly semismooth} are taken by chapter 2 of \cite{PBM}.
A function $f : \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is weakly semismooth if the classical directional derivative
\begin{equation}
f'(x,d)=\lim_{t\downarrow 0}\frac{f(x+t*d)-f(x)}{t}
\end{equation}
exists for all x and d, and
\begin{equation}
f'(x,d)=\lim_{t\downarrow 0}\xi(x+t*d)^{T}*d
\end{equation}
A function $f : \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is $f^{\circ}$-pseudoconvex if , if it is locally Lipschitz continuous and for all x, y $\in \mathbb{R}^n$
\begin{equation}
f(y)<f(x) \, implies \, f^{\circ}(x;y-x)<0
\end{equation}
Where $f^{\circ}(x;y)$ is the \textit{Clarke’s} generalized directional derivative of f at x in the direction y and is defined by
\begin{equation}
f^{\circ}(x,y)=\lim_{z\rightarrow x,t\downarrow 0}\frac{f(z+t*d)-f(z)}{t}
\end{equation}
We do not know is our loss function is $f^{\circ}$-pseudoconvex  and weakly semismooth. We think that the properties defined in section \ref{LF:Properties} can help to make it so.
