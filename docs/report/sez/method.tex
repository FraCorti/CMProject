Next, we expect a brief recall of the algorithmic properties that you expect to see in the experiments. Is the algorithm(if it is iterative) guaranteed to converge? Is it going to be stable and return a good approximation of the solution(if it is direct)? What is its complexity? Are there any relevant convergence results? Are the hypotheses of theseconvergence results (convexity, compactness, differentiability, etc.) satisfied by your problem? If not, what are the“closest” possible results you have available, and why exactly they arenotapplicable?  Do you expect this to berelevant in practice?Again, you are advised to send us a version of this section by e-mail as soon as it is done. Again, we do not wantto see code at this point.
