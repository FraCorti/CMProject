\section{Method}

\subsection{Momentum descent approach}
The momentum descent approach add to the stochastic gradient descent a technique for accelerating gradient descent that accumulates a velocity vector in directions of persistent reduction in the objective across iterations. 
\\
This algorithm is a gradient-based optimization. The main idea of this type of algorithm is to minimize a loss function (or cost/error function) following the direction given by the gradient computed in the current point of the function.
\\
What can be a problem in the gradient descent is the large amount of example that must be computed for each iteration. The opposite happens in the stochastic gradient descent where there is an online training. However, he SGD is not as stable as the classical GD, but it requires only the evaluation of one example for each iteration. 
Form now on, when we use talk about SDG, we refers to SDG with a subset of training dataset, called mini-batch or batch SDG.
\\
The convergence rate is of $O(\frac{1}{\sqrt{k}})$ (after k steps) when the algorithm is applied to a convex problem, if it is applied to a strongly convex problem the convergence rate is of $O(\frac{1}{k})$. (Mettere ref a libro di deeplearning)
\\
Momentum descent approach use the method of momentum to accelerate learning. It introduce a variable \textbf{v} in that we take account of the speed and direction at witch the parameters move through parameter space. The role of momentum is determined by the hyperparameter $\alpha\in[0,1)$.
The update rule is the following:
\begin{equation}
\label{classical_momentum}
\textbf{v}_k = \alpha\textbf{v}_{k-1} + \eta\nabla\textit{L}(\textbf{W}_k).
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\label{update_momentum}
\textbf{W}_k = \textbf{W}_{k-1}  + \textbf{v}_k.
\end{equation}
The Nesterov momentum is a variant of the classical Momentum, the main idea is to add a correction factor to the Nesterov momentum,  for this reason they differs in place where the gradient is evaluated. With Nesterov momentum the rate of convergence goes from $O(\frac{1}{k})$ to $O(\frac{1}{k^2})$.
The update rule for the velocity vector \textbf{v} is the following:
\begin{equation}
\label{nesterov_momentum}
\textbf{v}_k = \alpha\textbf{v}_{k-1} + \eta\nabla\textit{L}(\textbf{W}_k + \alpha\textbf{v}_{k-1}).
\end{equation}

 algorithm What is its complexity?

Is the algorithm(if it is iterative) guaranteed to converge? Is it going to be stable and return a good approximation of the solution(if it is direct)?  Are there any relevant convergence results?

Are the hypotheses of these convergence results (convexity, compactness, differentiability, etc.) satisfied by your problem? If not, what are the“closest” possible results you have available, and why exactly they are not applicable?  Do you expect this to be relevant in practice?

\subsection{Limited-memory quasi-Newton methods}
Limited-memory quasi-Newton methods are useful for solving large problems whose Hessian matrices cannot be computed at a reasonable cost or are not sparse.  
These methods maintain simple and compact approximations of Hessian matrices: instead of storing fully dense \textit{n} $\times$ \textit{n} approximations, they save only a few vectors of length \textit{n} that represent an approximation of it. 
 
The main idea of the L-BFGS algorithm is to use curvature information from only the most recent iterations to construct the Hessian approximation. Curvature information from earlier iterations, which is less likely to be relevant to the actual behavior of the Hessian at the current iteration is discarded in the interest of saving storage. 

\subsubsection{Limited memory BFGS}
L-BGFS algorithm derive from the BFGS method. So we begin our description of the L-BGFS method by recalling BFGS. 
Each step of the BGFS method has the form
\begin{equation}
\label{stepBFGS}
x_{k+1}=x_{k}-\alpha_{k}H_{k}\nabla f_{k} ,
\end{equation}
where $\alpha_{k}$ is the step length and $H_{k}$
is updated at every iteration by means of the formula

\begin{equation}
H_{k+1} = V^T_{k}H_{k}V_{k}+ \rho_{k}s_{k}s^T_{k}
\end{equation}
where 
\begin{align}
\rho_{k}=\frac{1}{y^T_{k}s_{k}}, & \qquad V_{k}=I-\rho_{k}y_{k}s^T_{k}, 
\end{align} 
and 
\begin{align}
s_{k}=x_{k+1}-x_{k}, & \qquad
y_{k}=\nabla f_{k+1} - \nabla f_{k}.
\end{align}
Since the inverse Hessian approximation $H_{k}$ will generally be dense, the cost of storing and manipulating it is prohibitive when the number of variable is large. To handle this problem, we store a \textit{modified} version of $H_{k}$, by storing a certain number (say, \textit{m}) of the vector pairs $\{s_{i},y_{i}\}$ used in the formulas (5) and (6). The product $H_{k}\nabla f_{k}$ can be obtained by performing a sequence of inner products and vector summations involving $\nabla f_{k}$ and the pairs $\{s_{i},y_{i}\}$. After the new iterate is computed, the oldest vector pair in the set of pairs $\{s_{i},y_{i}\}$ is replaced by the new pair $\{s_{k},y_{k}\}$ obtained from the current step (7).
In this way, the set of vector pairs includes curvature information from the \textit{m} most recent iterations. Usually \textit{m} between 3 and 20 is chosen. 

We now describe the updating processes. An iteration \textit{k}, the current iterate $x_{k}$ and the set of vector pairs is given by $\{s_{i},y_{i}\}$ for $i=k-m, ..., k-1$. We first choose some initial Hessian approximation $H^0_{k}$(in contrast to the standard BFGS iteration, this initial approximation is allowed to vary from iteration to iteration) and find by repeated application of the formula (5) that the L-BFGS approximation $H_{k}$ satisfies the following formula: 
\begin{equation} 
\begin{aligned}
&H_{k}=(V^T_{k-1}\cdots V^T_{k-m})H^0_{k}(V_{k-m}\cdots V_{k-1})\\           
&+\rho_{k-m}(V^T_{k-1}\cdots V^T_{k-m+1})s_{k-m}s^T_{k-m}(V_{k-m+1}\cdots V_{k-1})\\
&+\rho_{k-m+1}(V^T_{k-1}\cdots V^T_{k-m+2})s_{k-m+1}s^T_{k-m+1}(V_{k-m+2}\cdots V_{k-1})\\
&+ \cdots \\
&+\rho_{k-1}s_{k-1}s^T_{k-1}.  
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
From this expression we can derive a recursive procedure to compute the product $H_{k}\nabla f_{k}$ efficiently.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
	\caption{L-BFGS two loop recursion}
	\label{}
	\begin{algorithmic}[3]
		\State $q \gets \nabla f_{k}$;
		\For{$i=k-1,k-2,\cdots ,k-m$}
        \State $ \alpha_{i} \gets \rho_{i}s^T_{i}q$;
        \State $q \gets q - \alpha_{i}y_{i}$; 
      \EndFor
 	  \State $r \gets H^0_{k}q$;
 	  \For{$i=k-m,k-m+1,\cdots, k-1$}
 	  \State $\beta \gets \rho_{i}y^T_{i}r$; 
 	  \State $r \gets r + s_{i}(\alpha_{i}-\beta)$
 	  \EndFor
	  \State \textbf{stop} with result $H_{k}\nabla f_{k}=r$
	\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
Without considering the multiplication $H^0_{k}q $, the two-loop recursion scheme requires $4mn$ multiplications; if $H^0_{k}$ is diagonal, then $n$ additional multiplications are needed. Apart from being inexpensive, this recursion has the advantage that the multiplication by the initial matrix $H^0_{k}$ is isolated from the rest of the computations, allowing this matrix to be chosen freely and to vary between iterations. We may even use an implicit choice of $H^0_{k}$ by defining some initial approximation $B^0_{k}$ to the Hessian (not its inverse) and obtaining $r$ by solving the system $B^0_{k}r = q$. 

A method for choosing $H^0_{k}$ that has proved effective in practice is to set $H^0_{k}=\gamma_{k}I$  where 
\begin{equation}
\gamma_{k}= \frac{s^T_{k-1}y_{k-1}}{y^T_{k-1}y_{k-1}}
\end{equation}
As discussed in \texttt{REF sezione convergenza}, $\gamma_{k}$ is the scaling factor that attempts to estimate the size of the true Hessian matrix along the most recent search direction. This choice helps to ensure that the search direction $p_{k}$ is well scaled, and as result the step length $\alpha_{k}=1$ is accepted in most iterations. As discussed in \texttt{REF sezione convergenza}, it is important that the line search be based on the Wolfe conditions (\texttt{REF sez conv}) or strong Wolfe conditions(\texttt{REF sez conv}), so that BFGS updating is stable.

Limited-memory variants  of  the  quasi-Newton  approach use  Hessian  approximations  that  can  be stored compactly by using just a few vectors of length \textit{n}. These methods are fairly robust, inexpensive, and easy to implement, but they do not converge rapidly.

 
  Are the hypotheses of theseconvergence results (convexity, compactness, differentiability, etc.) satisfied by your problem? If not, what are the“closest” possible results you have available, and why exactly they arenotapplicable?  Do you expect this to berelevant in practice?
