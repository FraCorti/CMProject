\subsection{Momentum descent approach}

 algorithm What is its complexity?

Is the algorithm(if it is iterative) guaranteed to converge? Is it going to be stable and return a good approximation of the solution(if it is direct)?  Are there any relevant convergence results?

Are the hypotheses of theseconvergence results (convexity, compactness, differentiability, etc.) satisfied by your problem? If not, what are the“closest” possible results you have available, and why exactly they arenotapplicable?  Do you expect this to berelevant in practice?

\texttt{ Is the algorithm(if it is iterative) guaranteed to converge? Is it going to be stable and return a good approximation of the solution(if it is direct)?  Are there any relevant convergence results?}

Limited-memory variants  of  the  quasi-Newton  approach use  Hessian  approximations  that  can  be stored compactly by using just a few vectors of length \textit{n}. These methods are fairly robust, inexpensive, and easy to implement, but they do not converge rapidly.

\subsection{Bundle methods}


Next, we expect a brief recall of the algorithmic properties that you expect to see in the experiments. Is the algorithm(if it is iterative) guaranteed to converge? Is it going to be stable and return a good approximation of the solution(if it is direct)? What is its complexity? Are there any relevant convergence results? Are the hypotheses of theseconvergence results (convexity, compactness, differentiability, etc.) satisfied by your problem? If not, what are the“closest” possible results you have available, and why exactly they arenotapplicable?  Do you expect this to berelevant in practice?Again, you are advised to send us a version of this section by e-mail as soon as it is done. Again, we do not wantto see code at this point.
